  <h3 id="information-collected-and-stored-automatically">Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h3>
<p>This website automatically collects some basic system information to help us measure site performance and visitor volume. We also use this information to help us develop the site, analyze patterns of usage, address problem areas, and make the site more useful for you.</p>

<p>When you visit repository.pki.gov, we may store some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet protocol (IP) address from which you accessed the site;</li>
  <li>Date and time of your visit;</li>
  <li>Name of the file or words you searched;</li>
  <li>Items clicked on a page;</li>
  <li>Browser and operating system used; and</li>
  <li>Name of the website from which you linked to IDmanagement.gov</li>
  <li>We do not use this information to associate search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We do not share or sell visitor data for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="information-you-send-us">Information You Send Us</h3>
<p>This website does not collect personal information unless you choose to provide that information, such as by sending us an email. We only use the information you provide us to respond to your request. If necessary, our Web Team may forward your message to the government employee who can best answer your questions. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We do not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-cookies">Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>Like many websites, repository.pki.gov uses “persistent cookie” technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that this website places on your web browser so that it can gather anonymous summary demographic information, and remember your browser when it is used to visit our site again later—kind of like cookie crumbs (hence the name.) These cookies uniquely identify a browser on a computer, but never a person.  In other words, if the same person uses both Chrome and Internet Explorer, two unique browser cookies will be assigned, one for each browser, and that person will be counted as two different visitors because visits are based on browsers, not computers or persons.</p>

<p>We use persistent cookies in two ways, both of which enhance your experience on repository.pki.gov while also protecting your privacy:</p>

<p>To remember you when your browser comes back to the site, so we don’t invite you to take our customer satisfaction survey every time you visit.
To get aggregate metrics on site usage to understand how people are using the site and how we can make it better. Government agencies only ever receive traffic statistics anonymously and in the aggregate.
Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don’t want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Here’s how you can disable cookies.</p>

<h3 id="site-security">Site Security</h3>
<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>

<p>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.</p>

<p>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.</p>

<h3 id="other-website-policies">Other Website Policies</h3>

<h4 id="accessibility-policy">Accessibility Policy</h4>
<p>General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to providing access to all individuals—with or without disabilities—seeking information on this website. We’ve built this website to conform to the Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (as amended), which requires that all individuals with disabilities (whether federal employees or members of the general public) have access to, and use of, information and data comparable to that provided to individuals without disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on us.</p>

<h5 id="if-you-have-trouble-viewing-content">If you have trouble viewing content</h5>
<p>If you have difficulty accessing information on this site, particularly if using assistive technology, including screen readers, eye tracking devices, or voice recognition software, please contact us. You can do this by emailing us with the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>URL (web address) of the material you tried to access</li>
  <li>the problem you experienced</li>
  <li>your contact information</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll get back to you as soon as we can, and attempt to provide the information you’re seeking.</p>

<h4 id="3rd-party-plug-ins">3rd-party plug-ins</h4>
<p>Some content on this website may require use of a 3rd-party plug-in to view. Visit GSA.gov to find links to these plug-ins/accessibility aids. Please note these are non-government sites and GSA does not endorse these products. They’re listed only for your convenience. Please direct questions about each tool to the respective vendor.</p>

<h4 id="linking-policy">Linking Policy</h4>
<p>This website may include hypertext links or pointers to information created and maintained by other public or private organizations. GSA provides these links solely for your information and convenience. If you select a link to an outside website, you’re leaving the repository.pki.gov website and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the external website.</p>

<h5 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation criteria</h5>
<p>We evaluate all links to external websites using the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the website’s content relevant, useful and authoritative?</li>
  <li>Does the website’s information appear to be accurate and current?</li>
  <li>Does the website complement existing information, products and services?</li>
  <li>Is the website accessible and applicable to a complementary audience?</li>
  <li>Is the website’s approach to the privacy of personal information consistent with the government’s privacy and security policies?</li>
  <li>Is the primary intent of the website to educate and inform, rather than persuade, convert, or sell? The site may include advertising but must be free from heavy marketing or promotion of products.</li>
  <li>Is the website an official government-owned or supported website? If not, does the website provide government information and/or services in a way that is not available on an official government website?</li>
  <li>Does the website provide information free of charge?</li>
  <li>Is the website content consistent with sound public policy? Does it support the mission of GSA and its programs?</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="links-to-other-government-websites">Links to other government websites</h5>
<p>This website links to publicly available websites that are government-owned or government sponsored, including domains ending in .gov, .mil and .us. We may also link to quasi-government agencies and websites created by public/private partnerships; state and local government sites (e.g., www.maryland.gov); and government-sponsored websites that end in .com, .org, or .net (e.g., www.usps.com for the U.S. Postal Service).</p>

<p>Because the websites of other federal government agencies must follow the same policies as GSA, links to these sites (including sites managed by the U.S. military) are made without notification or disclaimer.</p>

<h5 id="links-to-non-government-websites">Links to non-government websites</h5>
<p>This website may link to non-government websites, if they provide relevant information that’s not available on an official government website. We provide these links as a public service only; the U.S. government, including GSA (as the sponsoring federal agency of repository.pki.gov), neither endorses nor guarantees in any way the external organizations, services, advice, or products included in these website links. Furthermore, the U.S. government neither controls nor guarantees the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of the information contained in non-government website links.</p>

<h5 id="disclaimer-of-endorsement">Disclaimer of endorsement</h5>
<p>The repository.pki.gov website includes hypertext links, or pointers, to information created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations. We provide these links and pointers only for your information and convenience. When you select a link to an outside website, you are leaving the repository.pki.gov site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website.</p>

<p>GSA and repository.pki.gov do not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked website.
We do not endorse the organizations sponsoring linked websites and we do not endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer.
The content of external, non-Federal websites is not subject to Federal information quality, privacy, security, and related guidelines.
We cannot authorize the use of copyrighted materials contained in linked websites. Users must request such authorization from the sponsor of the linked website.
We are not responsible for transmissions users receive from linked websites.
We do not guarantee that outside websites comply with Section 508 (accessibility requirements) of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>

<h5 id="prohibitions">Prohibitions</h5>
<p>GSA will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, or discrimination. Furthermore, we reserve the right to deny or remove any link that contains misleading information or unsubstantiated claims, or is determined to be in conflict with GSA’s mission or policies.</p>

<h4 id="required-links">Required Links</h4>
<p>Federal agencies are required to provide the following links/information on our websites.</p>
<ul>
  <li>GSA Privacy Policy</li>

  <li>Orders &amp; Directives</li>
  <li>Freedom of Information Act Requests</li>

<h4 id="social-media-sites">Social Media Sites</h4>
<p>Where we manage a presence on social media sites to share government information and engage with our audience, we do not collect any personally identifiable information through those sites. We do not use personal information made available by the third-party sites. If you submit a question or comment to us via a social media tool or platform, we may reply directly to you via that platform, but we don’t track or record any information about individuals who use or interact with us via those platforms.</p>
