### Server Authentication Certificate Profile

This profile for Server Authentication Certificates contains two (2) certificate types:

- _Domain Validation_ TLS Server Authentication Certificates
- _Organization Validation_ TLS Server Authentication Certificates

There are two (2) differences in the certificate profile implementations between Domain Validation and Organization Validation. The differences are in the _Subject Identity Information_ and the _Certificate Policies_.

| **Field or Extension** | **Domain Validation** | **Organization Validation**  |
| :-------- | :---: | :---: |
| Subject Identity Information  | cn=\<one domain name>,c=US | cn=\<one domain name>,S=District of Columbia,O=U.S.Government,c=US |
| Certificate Policies   | Asserts both the US Government and CAB Forum policy OIDs for Domain Validation      | Asserts both the the US Government and CAB Forum policy OIDs for Organization Validation  |

Below is the full server authentication certificate profile with _all_ fields and extensions.
