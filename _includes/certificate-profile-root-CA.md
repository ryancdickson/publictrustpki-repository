### Self-Signed Root CA Certificate Profile

| **Field** | **Value and Requirements**  |
| :-------- |  :-------------------------------     |
| Serial Number   | Serial number shall be a unique positive integer with a minimum of 64 bits of entropy generated by a CSPRNG. <br> Serial number shall not exceed 20 bytes in length. |
| Issuer Signature Algorithm   | sha256 WithRSAEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 11}  |
| Issuer Distinguished Name   | Root CA Certificate Issuer Distinguished Name (DN) shall be a unique X.500 DN as specified in Section 7.1.4 of this CP.  Distinguished Name shall conform to PrintableString string type in ASN.1 notation. <br><br>The Root CA Certificate DN shall be: <br>cn=US Federal TLS Root CAx, o=U.S. Government, c=US <br>where "x" is not used for the first Root CA certificate name and is a numeric value that starts at 2 and increments by 1 for any future Root CA certificate Common Names(cn). All non-production Root CA DNs shall include "Test" in the Common Name (cn). A non-production DN example is: <br>cn=US Federal Test TLS Root CA, o=U.S. Government, c=US <br> <br> |
| Validity Period   | Validity Period dates shall be encoded as UTCTime for dates through 2049 and GeneralizedTime for dates thereafter <br> Validity Period shall be no longer than 20 years from date of issue. |
| Subject Distinguished Name   | Subject Distinguished Name (DN) shall match the Issuer DN.   |
| Subject Public Key Information   | 4096 bit modulus, rsaEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 1}   |
| Issuer Signature   | sha256 WithRSAEncryption {1 2 840 113549 1 1 11}    |

| **Extension** |  **Required**   | **Critical** | **Value and Requirements** |
| :-------- | :----------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| subjectInfoAccess  | Mandatory | False |  id-ad-caRepository (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.5):<br>At least one instance of this access method shall be included.  All instances of this access method shall include the HTTP URI name form to specify an HTTP accessible location containing a BER or DER encoded “certs-only” CMS message as specified in [RFC5272]. |
| basicConstraints   | Mandatory | True |  cA=True <br> The pathLenConstraint field shall not be present. |
| subjectKeyIdentifier | Mandatory | False |  Octet String <br> Derived using SHA-1 hash of the public key  |
| keyUsage   | Mandatory | True | Bit positions for keyCertSign and cRLSign shall be set. <br> If the Root CA Private Key is used for signing OCSP responses, then the digitalSignature bit shall also be set.|
