      What is the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI?
    </button>
    <div id="a1" class="usa-accordion-content">	  
	  The U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI increases internet security – it further protects consumer privacy, protects website operators from spoofing incidents, and promotes an open and transparent internet PKI trust model.
	  
	  <br><br>
	  These added security measures meet new internet requirements for:
	  <ul>
		<li>Certificate Transparency (CT)</li>
		<li>Decreased validity lifetimes for certificates used by publicly trusted web services</li>
		<li>Public disclosure of all Certification Authorities’ certificate policies, practices, and procedures</li>
	  </ul>
	  The U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI meets the first two requirements by issuing publicly trusted TLS certificates to federal .gov and .mil web services, in accordance with the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements/" target="_blank">CA Browser Forum Baseline Requirements</a> and recognized standards.

      What is the relationship between the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI and the Federal PKI?
    </button>
    <div id="b3" class="usa-accordion-content">
      The General Services Administration currently oversees the Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI), a trust framework comprised of over two hundred Certification Authorities used to issue and manage person identity and enterprise device identity certificates for the Federal Government and mission partners. The FPKI is managed and operated as a bridged PKI, whose original purpose was intended to establish trust across related communities of interest. 
	  <br><br>
	  The U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI will be managed as a separate and distinct PKI.  It will support the automated issuance of publicly trusted TLS certificates to federal .gov and .mil web services.
	  <br><br>
	  The FPKI Policy Authority maintains the governance and voting rights to manage the U.S. Federal Public Trust TLS PKI Certificate Policy.

      What is HTTPS and why is it important?
    </button>
    <div id="a3" class="usa-accordion-content">
      Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) gives users a level of security and privacy when connecting to websites and web services.  
	  <br><br>
	  The internet's fundamental design gives both visitors and website owners very little control over where communications travel or whose devices carry them. To ensure secure communications across the internet, traffic must be encrypted from visitors' devices to website owners' devices.  That's exactly what HTTPS does. Without HTTPS, attackers can inject malware or tracking beacons, or otherwise monitor or change visitor interactions online.  
	  <br><br>
	  Without HTTPS, website visitors have no guarantee of privacy or security as they browse. A visitor's communication with a website could be modified or monitored by anyone or anything "between" them. An attacker could be someone using that coffee shop WiFi (or the coffee shop itself), or someone who's hacked an out-of-date load balancer that website traffic flows through on its way around the internet.
