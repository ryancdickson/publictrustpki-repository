### Information Collected and Stored Automatically
This website automatically collects some basic system information to help us measure site performance and visitor volume. We also use this information to help us develop the site, analyze patterns of usage, address problem areas, and make the site more useful for you.

When you visit repository.pki.gov, we may store some or all of the following:
- Internet protocol (IP) address from which you accessed the site;
- Date and time of your visit;
- Name of the file or words you searched;
- Items clicked on a page;
- Browser and operating system used; and
- Name of the website from which you linked to IDmanagement.gov
- We do not use this information to associate search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. We do not share or sell visitor data for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or any other commercial purpose.

### Information You Send Us
This website does not collect personal information unless you choose to provide that information, such as by sending us an email. We only use the information you provide us to respond to your request. If necessary, our Web Team may forward your message to the government employee who can best answer your questions. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We do not disclose, give, sell, or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute.

### Use of Cookies
Like many websites, repository.pki.gov uses “persistent cookie” technology. A persistent cookie is a small text file that this website places on your web browser so that it can gather anonymous summary demographic information, and remember your browser when it is used to visit our site again later—kind of like cookie crumbs (hence the name.) These cookies uniquely identify a browser on a computer, but never a person.  In other words, if the same person uses both Chrome and Internet Explorer, two unique browser cookies will be assigned, one for each browser, and that person will be counted as two different visitors because visits are based on browsers, not computers or persons.

We use persistent cookies in two ways, both of which enhance your experience on repository.pki.gov while also protecting your privacy:

To remember you when your browser comes back to the site, so we don’t invite you to take our customer satisfaction survey every time you visit.
To get aggregate metrics on site usage to understand how people are using the site and how we can make it better. Government agencies only ever receive traffic statistics anonymously and in the aggregate.
Most Internet browsers automatically accept persistent cookies. Although using persistent cookies creates a much better experience for you, this site will also work without them. If you don’t want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser’s options to stop accepting persistent cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Here’s how you can disable cookies.

### Site Security
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.

Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.

### Other Website Policies

#### Accessibility Policy
General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to providing access to all individuals—with or without disabilities—seeking information on this website. We’ve built this website to conform to the Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (as amended), which requires that all individuals with disabilities (whether federal employees or members of the general public) have access to, and use of, information and data comparable to that provided to individuals without disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on us.

##### If you have trouble viewing content
If you have difficulty accessing information on this site, particularly if using assistive technology, including screen readers, eye tracking devices, or voice recognition software, please contact us. You can do this by emailing us with the following information:
- URL (web address) of the material you tried to access

We’ll get back to you as soon as we can, and attempt to provide the information you’re seeking.

Some content on this website may require use of a 3rd-party plug-in to view. Visit GSA.gov to find links to these plug-ins/accessibility aids. Please note these are non-government sites and GSA does not endorse these products. They’re listed only for your convenience. Please direct questions about each tool to the respective vendor.

#### Linking Policy
This website may include hypertext links or pointers to information created and maintained by other public or private organizations. GSA provides these links solely for your information and convenience. If you select a link to an outside website, you’re leaving the repository.pki.gov website and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the external website.

##### Evaluation criteria
We evaluate all links to external websites using the following criteria:
- Is the website’s content relevant, useful and authoritative?
- Does the website’s information appear to be accurate and current?
- Does the website complement existing information, products and services?
- Is the website accessible and applicable to a complementary audience?
- Is the website’s approach to the privacy of personal information consistent with the government’s privacy and security policies?
- Is the primary intent of the website to educate and inform, rather than persuade, convert, or sell? The site may include advertising but must be free from heavy marketing or promotion of products.
- Is the website an official government-owned or supported website? If not, does the website provide government information and/or services in a way that is not available on an official government website?
- Does the website provide information free of charge?
- Is the website content consistent with sound public policy? Does it support the mission of GSA and its programs?

##### Links to other government websites
This website links to publicly available websites that are government-owned or government sponsored, including domains ending in .gov, .mil and .us. We may also link to quasi-government agencies and websites created by public/private partnerships; state and local government sites (e.g., www.maryland.gov); and government-sponsored websites that end in .com, .org, or .net (e.g., www.usps.com for the U.S. Postal Service).

Because the websites of other federal government agencies must follow the same policies as GSA, links to these sites (including sites managed by the U.S. military) are made without notification or disclaimer.

Furthermore, the U.S. government neither controls nor guarantees the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of the information contained in non-government website links.

##### Disclaimer of endorsement
The repository.pki.gov website includes hypertext links, or pointers, to information created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations.

GSA and repository.pki.gov do not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on a linked website.
